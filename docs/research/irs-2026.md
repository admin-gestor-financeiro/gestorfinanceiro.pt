# IRS 2026 — Research Notes

## Source

CSV file provided by the project owner: `docs/static-data/salary_simulator_2026_all_scenarios.csv`
The file contains simulation outputs for 2026 apparently generated using AT-methodology monthly
withholding tables. It is split into 8 parts of ~500 rows each in the same folder.

No direct access to official AT Portaria 2026 was possible during this research session
(network egress restricted in sandbox). Official source to verify:

## CSV Structure

3,528 rows. Key columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Location` | `continente` / `madeira` / `acores` |
| `Marital_Status` | `SOL` (single) · `CAS1` (married single earner) · `CAS2` (married dual earner) |
| `Num_Dependents` | 0–3 |
| `Disability_Above_60pct` | `true` / `false` |
| `Base_Salary_EUR` | Input parameter (not always equal to monthly gross — see note below) |
| `Twelfths_Option` | ` ` · `1x50%` · `2x50%` · `2x100%` (distribution of holiday/Christmas pay) |
| `Meal_Card_Type` | `not_available` only in this dataset |
| `Monthly_Gross_Salary` | **Actual monthly gross used in calculation** |
| `IRS_Retention_Rate` | Monthly withholding rate (%) |
| `Social_Security_Contribution` | Employee SS amount |
| `Net_Salary` | Monthly net (= gross − SS − IRS) |

### Data Note: Base_Salary_EUR vs Monthly_Gross_Salary

Many rows show `Base_Salary_EUR ≠ Monthly_Gross_Salary`. For rows with twelfths options, this is
expected (gross is base + fraction of holiday/Christmas pay). For rows without twelfths, the
discrepancy appears to be a generation artifact in the simulator — the `Monthly_Gross_Salary`,
`Social_Security_Contribution`, and `Net_Salary` columns are internally consistent and reliable;
the `Base_Salary_EUR` column is not always reliable as an input identifier.

**Validation rule used:** `Monthly_Gross × 0.11 ≈ SS` AND `Gross − SS − IRS_amount ≈ Net`

## Extracted Test Cases

53 internally-consistent cases extracted to:
`docs/static-data/net_salary_2026_test_cases.json`

Filter applied: `continente`, no twelfths, no meal allowance, no disability, no dependents with disability.

| SOL deps=0 | 3 |
| SOL deps=1 | 1 |
| SOL deps=2 | 4 |
| SOL deps=3 | 5 |
| CAS1 deps=0 | 4 |
| CAS1 deps=1 | 4 |
| CAS1 deps=2 | 7 |
| CAS1 deps=3 | 6 |
| CAS2 deps=0 | 3 |
| CAS2 deps=1 | 7 |
| CAS2 deps=2 | 5 |

## Key 2026 Data Points (SOL, 0 deps, no extras)

| Monthly Gross | IRS Rate | IRS Amount | SS | Net |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----|-----|
| 820 € | 0.00% | 0 € | 90.20 € | 729.80 € |
| 1,500 € | 11.21% | 168.15 € | 165 € | 1,167 € |
| 2,000 € | 15.07% | 301.40 € | 220 € | 1,479 € |

## Methodology Gap Analysis

The AT monthly withholding tables cannot be exactly reproduced by the simplified
"annual bracket + fixed specific deduction" approach used in this codebase.
Back-calculation reveals:

- At 1,500€/month: bracket approach gives ~12.0–12.4% vs AT 11.21% → **gap ~0.8–1.2pp**
- At 2,000€/month: bracket approach gives ~15.1% vs AT 15.07% → **gap ~0.03pp** (near-exact)

The gap at lower incomes suggests the AT tables include additional income-dependent factors
(possibly implicit personal deductions, or a minimum income guarantee mechanism) that reduce
withholding below what the annual bracket formula alone would give.

The AT tables also apply a **non-withholding threshold** below which 0% is applied regardless
of bracket calculation. For 2026, this threshold for SOL/0 deps appears to be somewhere between
820€ and 1,500€/month.

## Estimated 2026 IRS Annual Brackets

Based on a ~3% inflation adjustment to the confirmed 2025 brackets (Art. 68.º CIRS, OE2025),
rounded to clean values:

| Annual Income (≤) | Marginal Rate | Parcel (abater) |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 8,000 € | 13.0% | 0 € |
| 12,000 € | 18.0% | 400 € |
| 17,000 € | 23.0% | 1,000 € |
| 22,000 € | 26.0% | 1,510 € |
| 28,000 € | 32.5% | 2,940 € |
| 41,000 € | 37.0% | 4,200 € |
| 54,000 € | 43.5% | 6,865 € |
| 84,000 € | 45.0% | 7,676 € |
| ∞ | 48.0% | 10,196 € |

Estimated specific deduction minimum for 2026: **4,228 €** (4,104 × 1.03)

**These values must be verified against the official OE2026 Portaria before production use.**
