# IRS 2026 — Decision Record

[Research](../research/irs-2026.md)

## Decision

Implement 2026 IRS support using estimated annual brackets (2025 × ~3% inflation) with 2026
as the default selected year. Unit tests derived from the CSV will document the delta between
the bracket-based calculation and the AT monthly table values.

## Rationale

The AT monthly withholding tables for 2026 (Portaria) were not accessible during implementation.
The official source needs to be cross-checked at https://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt.

Using estimated brackets is preferable to shipping only 2025 data because:
1. 2026 is the current tax year — users running the calculator expect 2026 results by default
2. The methodology (annual bracket approach) is publicly documented and used by other PT calculators
3. Unit tests from the CSV make it easy to identify and fix the gap once official data is available

## Implemented 2026 Parameters

```
SPECIFIC_DEDUCTION_MIN: 4,228 € (estimated; 2025 was 4,104 €)

IRS brackets:
  ≤  8,000 €: 13.0%  parcel      0 €
  ≤ 12,000 €: 18.0%  parcel    400 €
  ≤ 17,000 €: 23.0%  parcel  1,000 €
  ≤ 22,000 €: 26.0%  parcel  1,510 €
  ≤ 28,000 €: 32.5%  parcel  2,940 €
  ≤ 41,000 €: 37.0%  parcel  4,200 €
  ≤ 54,000 €: 43.5%  parcel  6,865 €
  ≤ 84,000 €: 45.0%  parcel  7,676 €
  > 84,000 €: 48.0%  parcel 10,196 €
```

## Known Limitation

The bracket approach does not reproduce AT table results exactly, especially at lower incomes
(~0.8pp gap at 1,500€/month; near-exact at 2,000€+). The calculator UI includes a disclaimer
directing users to verify against AT official tables.

## Action Required

Once the OE2026 Portaria is published, update `IRS_BRACKETS_2026` and `SPECIFIC_DEDUCTION_MIN_2026`
in `lib/calculators/net-salary.ts` and rerun the unit tests to verify convergence.
